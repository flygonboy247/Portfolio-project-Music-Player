# Portfolio Project

In here is the steps and code done for my data structure MusicPlayer, It was
created for my portfolio project in CSE2231 and is my attempt to create a
usable and useful data structure that can store music information, although some
methods could be better implimented for use in a actual product(ex.get songs of
x author only giving back 1 song max), the use of some methods are more for
searching purposes(checking if there is a song by x author) rather than more
practical purposes(giving a list of songs by x author).

You can view the process of creation in the docs folder and the code in the src
folder while there are test cases for the implimentation in the test folder.
